# UFOs

## Overview
The objective of this challenge was to create a functional site using the map the client created.
- functional filter
- styled with provided css
- filters that can listen and update
## Results
The site was built based on the clients design, with functional for loops and filters based on city,state,country and shape.
the filters were designed to take in data for multiple areas and then update the new table and display it. I used code to to remove keys and values from 
a search if nothing was entered, then loops through data creating an array and building filtered data.
## Summary
This task was faily easy to set up as far as connecting the data sheet and css style sheets. Creating the code to auto filter 
and update once something had been entered into the field was more difficult and I used stackoverflow to help find a solution.
I also used the .toLowerCase() method to make sure results would come back.
